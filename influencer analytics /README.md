# Influencer Analytics

## Why Influencer?
Before moving into customer and commercial analytics, I spent 4 years working in the Influencer Marketing industry across consumer goods and DTC e-comm brands. Whilst I am not longer specialising in this field, I am often known as a subject expert in all things influencer marketing analytics due to the solutions I have individually created for multiple brands.

## What is Influencer Analytics?
Whilst Influencer Marketing is stepping into maturity, many brands do not know how to execute data-driven influencer recruitment and marketing. As an analyst, I find this space extremely exciting with so much opportunity to innovate with teh right reporting processes, data infrastructure and insight-driven education for business stakeholders. 

### Challenges with Influencer Marketing Analytics
- Inconsistent, and always changing, access to social media metrics based on both creator and user level permissions
- Inevitable manual data entry requirements across multiple platforms creates challenges amongst larger teams 
  - Need for consistent naming conventions across multiple data sources (e.g. invoices, social media platforms, paid media ad names

### Specific Experience
- Designing data taxonomy for an entire schema
- Rolling out global tracking processed, including learning resources and training seminars
- Reporting solutions for fully manual reporting processes
- Reporting solutions for automated reporting solutions by comibining data from multiple API's
- Tracking the footprint of an Influencer across various brand touchpoints
- Introducing quality metrics to focus teams on efficiency over vanity metrics
- Influencer segmentation using K-Means clustering
- Recruiting external API partners for social media post tracking
