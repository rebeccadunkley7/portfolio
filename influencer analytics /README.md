# Influencer Analytics

## Why Influencer?
Before moving into customer and commercial analytics, I spent 4 years working in the Influencer Marketing industry across consumer goods and DTC e-comm brands. Whilst I am not longer specialising in this field, I am often known as a subject expert in all things influencer marketing analytics due to the solutions I have individually created for multiple brands.
